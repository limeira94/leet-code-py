"""
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving
the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
